Here are some of our finds, reviews, and other stuff from the opening days of the year 2022. We were busy trying out various new methods of presenting these collections. If you’re reading this, this is what we settled on as the new home for *Evening of Light* things!

Alphabetically for now, but who knows what we’re gonna settle on next week?

Be welcome to our new home <3

**anrimeal** - *Could Divine, Remembered*
2021, self
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3121862617/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://anrimeal.bandcamp.com/album/could-divine-remembered">Could Divine, Remembered by anrimeal</a></iframe>
What a gloriously fragile set of studio reflections on and ‘remixes’ of De Melo Alves’ debut *Could Divine* from 2020. Compu-folk indeed, with soft-sung/strummed songs sitting next and into ethereal synths and vocal manipulations, spoken word memos, and raw studio talk outtakes. Selected with a masterful ear for coherence.

**Aureole** - *Alunarian Bellmaw*
2021, Vigor Deconstruct
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2844372934/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://markovsoroka.bandcamp.com/album/alunarian-bellmaw">Alunarian Bellmaw by Aureole</a></iframe>
What a stunning return for Aureole! Hovering somewhere in space(!) between black metal and funeral doom is this trio of crushing cosmic void channeling.

**Cindytalk** - *Camouflage Heart*
1984, Midnight Music

Here’s your reminder that the heaviest music of the 80s was not (just) in metal. Cindytalk’s debut is an absolute classic; gut-wrenching tunes straddling industrial, post-punk, and noise rock. This project has been on our radar for a long time, but perhaps now is the time for that proper deep-dive.

**COIL** - *Live at New Forms III*
2002

FURTHER BACK AND FASTER.
BACKWARDS.
FUCK ME FROM BEHIND.
FUCK ME IN REVERSE.
NORMAL IS PERVERSE.
EVERTHING’S BACKWARDS.

**David Colohan** - *Small Moves, Ellie, Small Moves*
2021, self
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1361001808/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e99708/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://davidcolohan.bandcamp.com/album/small-moves-ellie-small-moves">Small Moves, Ellie, Small Moves by David Colohan</a></iframe>
Although it was overshadowed by *Darlington Point* in my 2021 listening habits, *Small Moves, Ellie, Small Moves* is the more longform, just as wistful companion it deserves. The expansive synth pieces channel landscapes, as they often do in Colohan’s works. This time, inspired by the collapse of the Arecibo observatory in Puerto Rico, the cosmic is drawn down in small, measured, gradual steps, accompanied by touches of mournful strings, bowed and plucked. Someone should put this out on tape this year.

**David Sylvian** - *brilliant trees sessions . Berlin . 1983*

Lovely to see some of these greats at work in the studio. Sylvian, Sakamoto, the late Jon Hassell, and more!

**Gravesend** - *Methods of Human Disposal*
2021, 20 Buck Spin
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3243627637/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://listen.20buckspin.com/album/methods-of-human-disposal">Methods Of Human Disposal by Gravesend</a></iframe>
What a filthy piece of despair over urban decay. Black, death, grinding. No redemption here. One of the more critically acclaimed excrements of the fine year 2021, and it’s plain to see why. A collection of piercing vignettes.
