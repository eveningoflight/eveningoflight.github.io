**CC Sorensen** - *Twin Mirror*
2022, Full Spectrum
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2164708842/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=2ebd35/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://fullspectrumrecords.bandcamp.com/album/twin-mirror">Twin Mirror by CC Sorensen</a></iframe>
Otherworldly delights on CC Sorensen’s debut. *Twin Mirrors* calls lightly towards new agey jazz and synth greats of the 70s, but this is very much a 21st century piece, where a variety of instruments frolic around field recordings and glitchy spoken snippets. The frogs are out there playing concrète jams. You just have to find them.
