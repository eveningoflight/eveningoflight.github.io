**CC Sorensen** - *Twin Mirror*
2022, Full Spectrum

Otherworldly delights on CC Sorensen’s debut. *Twin Mirrors* calls lightly towards new agey jazz and synth greats of the 70s, but this is very much a 21st century piece, where a variety of instruments frolic around field recordings and glitchy spoken snippets. The frogs are out there playing concrète jams. You just have to find them.

**Dödsrit** - *Mortal Coil*
2021, Wolves of Hades

Does Dödsrit’s blackened crusty D-beat still kick ass after three albums? Does that genre still sound like something you want to eat? Yes and yes. All is not well with the world, but at least we have that. These four tracks blend neck-wrecking riffing with more contemplative passages. They bear repeating, and every time they’re a small injection of vitality. Funny, that, for a band called ‘death rite’. We’ll take it.
