**CC Sorensen** - *Twin Mirror*
2022, Full Spectrum

Otherworldly delights on CC Sorensen’s debut. *Twin Mirrors* calls lightly towards new agey jazz and synth greats of the 70s, but this is very much a 21st century piece, where a variety of instruments frolic around field recordings and glitchy spoken snippets. The frogs are out there playing concrète jams. You just have to find them.

**Dödsrit** - *Mortal Coil*
2021, Wolves of Hades
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=536907068/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e99708/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://dodsrit.bandcamp.com/album/mortal-coil">Mortal Coil by Dödsrit</a></iframe>
Does Dödsrit’s blackened crusty D-beat still kick ass after three albums? Does that genre still sound like something you want to eat? Yes and yes. All is not well with the world, but at least we have that. These four tracks blend neck-wrecking riffing with more contemplative passages. They bear repeating, and every time they’re a small injection of vitality. Funny, that, for a band called ‘death rite’. We’ll take it.

**Jack DeJohnette** - *Zebra*
1986, Pan
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H_6YzPKTKRg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
A consistently engaging synth jazz album that sees DeJohnette reach for the Siel DK600 for both key and percussion instruments, with the exception of Lester Bowie’s powerful trumpet work. Apparently not DeJohnette’s best work, according to the critics, so that means I have some digging to do!

**Sivyj Yar** - *Golden Threads*
2022, Avantgarde Music
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=830941518/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://avantgardemusic.bandcamp.com/album/golden-threads">Golden Threads by Sivyj Yar</a></iframe>
When we saw that a new Sivyj Yar was coming out we were enthusiastic, as always, but we didn’t quite expect it to take this form: a fragile suite of romantic acoustic pieces. Filled with the trademark melancholy that’s also present in the project’s usual black metal material, but carried mainly by gusli (Novgorod zither) and back with flute, electric bass, and balalaika.
