Here are some of our finds, reviews, and other stuff from the opening days of the year 2022. We were busy trying out various new methods of presenting these collections. If you’re reading this, this is what we settled on as the new home for *Evening of Light* things!

Alphabetically for now, but who knows what we’re gonna settle on next week?

Be welcome to our new home <3

**Blood Sport** - _Hot Blood and Cold Steel_
(2021, Gates of Hell)

Imagine **Motörhead** fronted by **Siouxsie Sioux**. Kinda. With apologies to all actually more similar-sounding (metal) singers out there. I'm new here. 
Regardless, Finland's Blood Sport have got you covered. Absolutely top notch speed metal bangage on this EP. I can't wait for more of this.

**Loscil** - *Triple Point*
2001, Kranky

Was bathing and falling asleep to the respective halves of Loscil's debut album, which turned 20 last year. Seriously chill ambient beatworks, capable of maintaining a constant level of engagement.

**Ross Goldstein** - *Timoka*
2020, Birdwatcher

Sparse evocative jazz mellotron soundtracking for imaginary spaces.

**Trhä** - _inagape_
(2021, self)
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=911121492/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=4ec5ec/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://trha.bandcamp.com/album/inagape">inagape by Trhä</a></iframe>
Slightly rockier than the year's earlier critic darling _endlhëtonëg_, and with some different vocal touches, this is another confirmation for me that this is no band to sleep on. One of those black metal bands where the seemingly obscure production actually allows for a surprising amount of depth. I love it! And what a mood on that final organ track.
