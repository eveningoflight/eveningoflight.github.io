“It’s cool?” asked Spalding. His expression was both earnest and coy.
“It’s cool,” I said.
The cat circled the temple. Its naked skin was like obsidian. The mouth was open, revealing two rows of sharklike teeth.
“Kitty, kitty,” said Spalding.

“Shh,” said the cat. The cat looked at the fading stars in the morning sky through the opening in the temple’s atrium.
“Pretty,” said Spalding.
“What’s your name?” I asked.
“My name?” said the cat. “My name is Kitty.”
There is no alternative to dreaming in this place.
“Is there any other magic here?”
“There is always magic here.” The cat looked at the surrounding jungle.
“But you’re not controlling it?”
“I am always controlling it. Magic is my purrview. Kitty is jazz.” 

An acolyte swept the flagstones, but there seemed to be no dust anywhere, except that which we had brought in with our boots. The altar was empty. The cat moved silently around us. Today is the day that sounds like a dust wind. Today is the day that sounds like a wailing child. Today is the day that sounds like a fox hunting in the night. The gong struck the hour. The shadows lengthened. The cat’s ears twitched. The heavy strikes rang out as the sun climbed the desert sky. Timoka is an album of continuing tension. It rises, hovers, and falls. It is dense, but not heavy. It is dark, but not scary.

“Good Kitty,” said Spalding. 
“Kitty is a cat.”
“Kitty is a jazz cat.”
