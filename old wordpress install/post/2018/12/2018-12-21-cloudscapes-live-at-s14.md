On December 16th a bunch of ladies gathered in an Antwerp basement to make a bunch of noise. It was good.

I was ecstatic when the organiser asked me around a month earlier whether I'd like to be a DJ for a **Deeat Palace** performance—**Vehemen** was added to the bill later. While I've been doing these online mixes for over eight years now, it's been a long time since I deejayed a live set—so long that I'm too embarrassed to admit how long—and it had been something of a low key dream for me to start doing that again. So first of all, thanks immensely to Diny for giving me the opportunity to do just that.

The evening was a resounding success, in my opinion. We gathered in S14, which is an Antwerp townhouse converted into a queer living/art/hack space. We hooked up our wires, pumped sound from the basement to the living room which would become a social / chill area for the guests later that night. And we pumped video, too! (Thanks Caro Orca). Both Deeat Palace and Vehemen delighted with super-intense rhythmic noise sets, of which you can get a chaotic impression in my insta videos ici (caution, this shit is LOUD):

You know what was the great thing? This whole evening was produced by women, ~90% of the guests were women, and the vibe was the absolute best. You and I both know that experimental and underground music is, like pretty much all music, a male-dominated field, and this is reflected in many gigs, events, and other scene things. Of course this is not always a huge problem as long as dudes behave themselves, but, well… yeah, we know how _that_ goes.

But that's why this was such a refreshing event to be and play at, and I hope I reflected that in my playlist, which is purposefully focused sharply (_almost_ exclusively) on female artists. This meant a bit more digging through my collection, but I believe the result is worth it. So, enjoy these studio impressions (think of them as platonic ideals or alternate takes) of the set I played at S14:
