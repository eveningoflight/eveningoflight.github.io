Internet music collaboration is cool. 100% live collaboration over Discord is way cooler, and that's just what **[valyri](https://valyri.com/music)** [](https://valyri.com/music)and **[r0x4ry](https://r0x4ry.bandcamp.com/)** [](https://r0x4ry.bandcamp.com/)did. Releasing their weird hybrid child _chromatic_ under the moniker **altostrati**, the two serve up over an hour of really intense dronescapes. It's loud, dense, drenched in wet air strata, and more than a bit melancholy about the cold winds that await us this season.

You can listen to a preview excerpt from the long track right here, right now, and be sure to stay tuned for the full release _chromute_, which is out on the first day of the new year—yes really—on the venerable **[No Problema Tapes](https://noproblematapes.bandcamp.com/)**.
