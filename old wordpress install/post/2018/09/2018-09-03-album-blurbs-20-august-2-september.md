**The Necks** do a big ol' gig-like jam on an album thing, and I'm down with it. _Body_' has rocking parts, ambient parts.

Piano, bass, guitar, keys, and sweet percussion.

_Prosperpolder_ is **David Colohan**'s latest collection of synth works, out on Was Ist Das?

Haunting, breathtaking, inspired by the outstretched landscapes of the Low Countries' polders.

Borgne hit hard with their doomy black metal on \[∞\], their 8th album, out on Avantgarde Music.

Synthised, spacy, atmospheric at times, but brutal, too.

_vol. 1_ of Figure and Ground's 'Archival Series of Live Instrumentals' houses six adventurous jazz fusion tracks by **Bogie**, **Kaufman**, & **Mann**.

Great dynamics, with hard rocking parts, but also room for soft melodies on guitar and woodwinds to shine.

**The Dark Red Seed** _Becomes Awake_ on their first full length album, out on Prophecy earlier this year.

A diverse album of gothy psychedelic folk rock, with a lovely strings and horn section, and well-integrated Indian and Persian influences.

Want more psychedelics? **Temple Music** has got you covered.

Folk tracks alternate with industrial synth ambiences and spacey rock. Quite the trip!

Experimental synth, ambient, and assorted electronics, all by trans women, on the cuttingly titled _audiogynephilia_.

Features works by **Argiflex**, **L'amante**, **Sadfem**, **Laurel Blossom**, and others.

Big ??? to my sisters.

_Crash\_Reports_ by **Suumhow** is full of glitchy, grainy melodies and beats. This Brussels-based duo has made a very fine debut (out on n5MD) of what we people called IDM back in the day.

Bright, textured, and even slightly danceable if you put your mind to it.

After two nice short releases, **Hundred Year Old Man** reach maturity on their debut LP _Breaching_' (all out on Gizeh Records).

Their mid-tempo post-metal is extremely engaging, with a smooth balance of heavy material, ambience, and field recordings.

I do wish we could retire "post-metal" as a term, but this album does fit the bill. The focus is more on flowing structures and crescendos than the jarring riffage of metal 'proper'.

Regardless, these guys have mastered it here.
