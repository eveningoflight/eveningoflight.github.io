I'm 100% here for **Aïsha Devi**'s ritual techno. 2015's _Of Matter And Spirit_ is a dark, intricate, danceable work that's incredibly rewarding, whether you're calmly listening or moving along to it. This is going on my DJ playlist for sure.

This is just what Mummy needed right now. Over 90 minutes of top-hole **argiflex** remixes on _Suffocation: The Throatless Remixes_ (2017, Bedlam Tapes). Jungle, hard beats, soft electronics.

What appears to start out as some good but unsurprising vaporwave turns into sophisticated ambient and soft beat territory on later tracks, while never completely letting go of its vapor inspirations. **Love Hotel究極** has an atmosphere entirely its own.

Ooh, this is good. Mysterious ambient with a strong melodic guitar and synth focus. _Beyond the Broken Ice_ by **Matt Frank & The Manic Moon** (2018, No Problema Tapes) is a very evocative spacy trip that steers away from many clichés of ambient and post-rock.

This is some hard-hitting stuff from Angolan-via-Mancunian **Nazar**. _Enclave_ explores the violent (post)colonial history of Angola through abstract techno, gun samples, and noisy edges. Taking and darkening Kuduro music, Nazar turns popular music into a weapon against oppression. And yeah, dancing against oppression is super legit. Out now digitally on Hyperdub, vinyl in January.

**Various Artists** - _Torque_ (1997, No U Turn)

A truly essential drum & bass 'compilation', this one contains works by **Ed Rush**, **Nico**, **Trace**, and **Fierce** in various constellations. Inventive and varied beatworks with a dark atmosphere. The second disc, a non-stop live mix by Rush, is especially worthwhile, but unfortunately not on Spotify.
