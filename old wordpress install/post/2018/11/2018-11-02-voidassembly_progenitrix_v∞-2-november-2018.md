Leave your expectations at the door for the new **Alpha DreamDrift X** album… _Ætherloop_ runs the gamut from electropop songs and and oldschool house/D&B atmospheres to gorgeous swathes of ambient synth. Masterful, and peerless in its diversity.

Synth-heavy, and as warmly spooky as ever (yes, that's a thing), _The Quietened Mechanisms_ is perfect **A Year in the Country** material. Class A material by **The Heartwood Institute**, **Howlround**, **Grey Frequency**, **Listening Center**, **Sproatly Smith**, et al.

Classic drones and synth whirlings from **FOUDRE!** on their fourth album _KAMI 神_. As always, the improvised, ritual quality of this quartet's music is enthralling. Out November 18th on Gizeh Records.

**John Coltrane** - _Lush Life_

Yes, we love transcendental free jazz Coltrane, but let's not forget about late 50s laid back Coltrane. This is loungy, but infused with sophisticated lyricism. Just a trio on the first three tracks (Coltrane, Earl May, Art Taylor), and with an expanded band on the last two, which are taken from different sessions.

**Keith Jarrett**’s _Staircase_ (1977, ECM) is a suite of four pieces for solo piano. Jarrett keeps time, ascending and descending, moving with the seasons. This is free, meandering, and confident, often with a whiff of his voice underpinning his play.

_The Ultimate Climax_ by **QUAL** (2018, AVANT! Records) is crazy, dark, powerful. Hardcore coldwave for those who like it a bit on the freaky side. Put on your mask, do a little dance, get down with QUAL's depravity.

**Sidewalks and Skeletons**' latest is also their best… _The Void_ (2017, 2018 Geometric Lullaby) nails the aesthetic, but also brings the music deeper into a kind of goth shoegaze territory. This one gives me solace, makes me want to slowdance with myself.
