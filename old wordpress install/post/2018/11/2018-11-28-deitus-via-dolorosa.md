**DEITUS**  
_Via Dolorosa_  
2018, I, Voidhanger

* * *

**DEITUS**' _Via Dolorosa_ is, for lack of a better term, thoughtful black metal. Yes, there's always going to be a certain aggression and darkness to this kind of music, but the band take a lot of time to craft broad vistas rather than pure oppression.

This is most evident in DEITUS' use of expansive solos and ponderous tempos, offering the listener respite and room to think, rather than sweeping them along in a rush of pure energy and/or filthy rawness, like much black metal. These five tracks offer a lot of variation in terms of riffs and melody, while maintaining a very coherent and unique overall sound.

It is fitting that an album that deals with the cleansing of sins and impurities through ordeal and ritual has a strong doomy vibe. It is the balance between contemplation, exposition, and occasional outbursts that make _Via Dolorosa_ such a strong work.

> _Via Dolorosa_ is out December 14 on CD [through I, Voidhanger](https://i-voidhangerrecords.bandcamp.com/album/via-dolorosa).
