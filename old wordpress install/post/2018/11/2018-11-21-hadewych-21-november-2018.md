Normally this would be on Μηλινόη's plate, but I'm stealing it because these riffs are just so juicy and thrashy. **Antiverse**'s _Under the Regolith_ is some ultra-tight cosmic death thrash and I love it to bits. More hooks than a Bassmaster, and superb solos as well, one of which is by my main man Tanner Anderson (**Obsequiae**) who also does backing vox and hammered dulcimer (!), so that makes it officially awesome™️.

(Out now on tape through Tridroid Records and on CD through Seeing Red)

'Unorthodox Doom from France'. Yup, this sure fits the bill! At first you think you're gonna get some old school doom with theatrical vocals, and yes, you do, but there are a lot of explorations in the riffing that set **Dionysiaque** apart from some of its inspirations. There's a slight black metal edge in some moments, in the vocals too, and more proggy touches in others. This untitled demo is solid gold in my book. Keep an eye on these dudes.

Always respecting the classics, and **Eco Virtual**'s chillwave certainly is classic. _ATMOSPHERES 第1_ (2013) is where it started. All pop-based, but eking out a slight new age / naturewave edge here and there.

**Kürøishi**'s _Slukad av Slutet_ is an absolutely furious short slab of heavy d-beat crust from Finland. No punches are pulled whatsoever, lyrically or musically. And that final track… you'll just have to hear it.

Smoooooooth. And Crispy! **Trademarks & Copyrights** have a new EP on Bogus Collective (_Against the Clock_) and it's chock full of deliciously chill babewave tunes, as usual. Time to get in the mood…

**A Tribe Called Quest** - _The Low End Theory_ (1991, Jive)

Talking about classics… The title on this one couldn't have been better, because on the one hand it's low end that takes center stage here: this album is heavy as fuck, and it knows it. On the other hand, this stuff is cerebral: incredibly good rhymes and flow, synced perfectly with aforementioned heavy jazzy beats.

And another nice 'oldie': it's **waterfront dining** on Sunset Recordings (2016) with _Clock Mannequins_. Romantic and smooth as always, with a variety of vocal styles.

Hey hey hey! Time to go shopping with **ハリウッドの食料品** on _CULTURE CYCLE_! The muzak is prepped and ready for your stroll through the mall. Just be sure not to trip over any clothing racks that have suddenly moved. And ugh, did someone open all those Doritos bags and just leave them there? The nacho dust is choking the air all around this section. Give your shopping cart a good push and coast on out of here if you wanna survive… (2018, Junk Maker Sounds)
