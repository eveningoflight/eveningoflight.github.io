**The Penitential Station**  
_The Cloud of Forgetting  
_2018, Other Forms of Consecrated Life

* * *

_The Cloud of Forgetting_ is a cloud of bliss: it is a forgetting of both past and future, as we are drawn into an eternal now that secludes us from worry.

We keep coming back to the same moment: a single passage in the choir's performance of Da Palestrina. We explore the cathedral, experience the differences in acoustics from each angle, in each nook and cranny. The same moment, in infinite ways.

And there is no cathedral, only a cloud. There is no substance, only empty vestments, billowing in the wind.

In this eternal moment, we are purified of all temporalities, we can atone for our manipulations, and draw strength from this beatific penance.

We'll need that strength when the moment ends, and we are set down on our own two feet again, as we inevitably are.

> _The Cloud of Forgetting_ came out in September on [Other Forms of Consecrated Life](https://otherforms.bandcamp.com/album/the-cloud-of-forgetting).
