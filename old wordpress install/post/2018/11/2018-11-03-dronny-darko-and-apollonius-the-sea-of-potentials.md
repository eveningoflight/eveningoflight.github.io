**Dronny Darko** and **Apollonius**  
_The Sea of Potentials_  
2018, ΠΑΝΘΕΟΝ

_The Sea of Potentials_ is about the possibilities of things in hidden places. Places where entities can grow and evolve in isolation, away from prying eyes and meddling fingers. It's an ode to the unknown, and to _embracing_ the unknown as it lurks just beyond the border of our perception.

These two ambient artists—one Ukrainian, one Dutch—have found each other's wavelength perfectly. It's hard to tell who has brought what influences and sounds to the table here: the result is so seamless. The same goes for the blend of organic field recorded sounds and synthesised tones: both meld into one coherent palette of sound.

It's dark ambient, but dark in the sense of obscured, out of sight. We can't see, but we can hear. Not a literal sea, but perhaps a symbolic wetland, home to rippling brooks, tiny waterfalls, insects, the footsteps of a traveller. And the sound of that hidden potential, softly pulsing and vibrating.

_The Sea of Potentials_ is a place that is nowhere, and hence the perfect place for the mind to set out towards.

> _The Sea of Potentials_ came out September 22 on [ΠΑΝΘΕΟΝ](https://pantheophania.bandcamp.com/album/the-sea-of-potentials).
