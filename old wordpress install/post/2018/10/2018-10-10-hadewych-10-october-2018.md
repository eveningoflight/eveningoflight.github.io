**Beastmaker** - _EP.4_ (2018, Church)

Continuing with the series, as promised! Four more solid compositions, horrorish without being scary, classic doom with equal parts Sabbath and Pallbearer.

**Braz** - _Brazpark_ (2017, Top Notch)

Hedda likes Dutch hiphop on occasion! _Brazpark_ combines hard swagger with a lot of introspection and Brabo pride. Most importantly it contains the guilty pleasure terror anthem "Testosteronbommen". 

Plus on "Voor 1 Dag" he imagines what it would be like to have a pussy. Make of that what you will.

**Cacola** - _Flower_ (2018, Business Casual)

Vapor-tinged pop mashups are what _Flower_ by **Cacola** is about, and they do it with panache. Particular kudos for the Lady Gage vs Gotye extravaganza that starts this swell EP (2018, Business Casual).

**Dirt Woman** - _Dirt Woman_ (2018)

We got some nice fuzzy psychedelic stoner on this self-titled EP by **Dirt** Woman. Groovy and heavy, with Zoe Koch's yowling effect-laden vocals center stage. And of course +1 for sampling _Pink Flamingos_.

**Diskette Park** is a master of the 80s pop synth backing sound, whether it's through sampling or composition—it's sometimes hard to tell the two apart. _Trackpoint Drift_ (2017, Business Casual) contains a breadth of sound within that terrain: athletic anthems, commercial jingles, slow jams, upbeat pop.

**Megadeth** - _Peace Sells… But Who's Buying?_ (1986, Capitol)

I suppose it's the little brother to _Master of Puppets_, or the surly cousin that scowls from the shadows while the other stands in the spotlight. But _Peace Sells_ is a strong album, and a rightful thrash classic. It's mostly mid-tempo, even a bit cerebral and proggy at times.

**Saint Vitus** - _Hallow's Victim_ (1985, SST)

Vitus' last album before **Wino** joined is a solid uptempo doom affair where the trademark guitar sound is already strongly present. And in all honesty, despite _Born Too Late_'s classic status, this one has better solos.

**Voïvod** - _Rrröööaaarrr_ (1986, Combat)

Crude, raw, and energetic. That's what Hedda likes! This is barbarian thrash the way it's supposed to be done. Different from their later work, but who cares?
