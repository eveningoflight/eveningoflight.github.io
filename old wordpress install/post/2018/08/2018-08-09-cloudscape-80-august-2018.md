After a hiatus I'm back in the mixing business. This one features a lot of music covered in my new print zine _Ex Abyssō_ [(http://www.eveningoflight.nl/exabysso/2018/08/01/ex-abysso-i-august-2018/)](http://%28http//www.eveningoflight.nl/exabysso/2018/08/01/ex-abysso-i-august-2018/)) as well as other new music.

We move from ambient acoustics, traditional influences, to rhythms and sounds increasing in intensity.
