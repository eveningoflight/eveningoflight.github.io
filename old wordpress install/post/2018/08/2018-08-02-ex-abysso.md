_[![](images/xayo1_issue_cover-212x300.jpg)](http://www.eveningoflight.nl/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/xayo1_issue_cover.jpg)Evening of Light_ has been a bit silent here (albeit less so on Twitter and [our official Discord channel](https://discord.gg/F7SmUzb) — come say hi!), but we haven't been idle. Apart from the site redesign, we have something even better:

The first issue of _Ex Abyssō_ was published yesterday. This zine is a new home for short reviews, personal essays, art, and more, and each issue comes with an EP of music by selected artists!

Please have a look at the zine's own sub-domain on _Evening of Light_ for more info: [http://www.eveningoflight.nl/exabysso/](http://www.eveningoflight.nl/exabysso/).
