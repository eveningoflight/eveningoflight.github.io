**Aaron Novik** has been putting out interesting experimental jazz stuff left and right this year. In the company of those other works, the _Rotterdam_ EP is gentle, mournful, even nostalgic. Flowing woodwinds with violin, accordion, bass, and drums. Located in memory, between place and imagination. A little gem. Out through Avant LaGuardia.

Just some rad cut-up vocal/noise pieces from **Annie Anxiety** on _Barbed Wire Halo_ way back in 1981. This came out on a Crass Records 7" at the time.

Perfection in the blend of piano, accordion, and oud on _Le Voyage de Sahar_ by **Anouar Brahem** (+ François Couturier / Jean-Louis Matinier). Delicate, subtle, warm and rich. (2006, ECM)

**Billie Holiday** - _Songs for Distingué Lovers_ (1957, Verve)

Sometimes, oftentimes, it's time for the classics. Smooth, oh so warm, and as distinguished as the invoked lovers. If you can't go to the nightclub, why not have the nightclub come to you?

Despite severe mental disturbances I am pleasantly absorbed by the textured noises on **b ｌ ａ ｃ ｃ ｌ ｏ ｄ ｇ ｅ**'s _dust of deimos_. Almost half an hour of fuzzy sound layers, bells, and fine grains of stuff. Enjoy. (2017, Junk Maker Sounds)

These soothing post-rock shoegazy tunes from **Lavinia** on _Sallowed_ are appreciated. Contains plenty of nice emotional moments, but doesn't stray far from the beaten path in terms of melodies and structure. Out since July 26 through Pax Aeternum.

**Milt Jackson** shreds on the vibraphone, and don't you forget it. This early Blue Note compilation from 1952 (also known as _Wizard of the Vibes_) with the **Thelonious Monk quartet** is a mix of agitated and chill bluesy numbers that are hard to resist.

Surprisingly catchy lounge jazz grooves on _**Resavoir**_'s s/t debut LP. It goes down very easy, but it nourishes, too. Warm, with lovely bass, harp, trumpet, flute, drums, and more, all of it subtly hiphop-inflected. Out since June 26 on International Anthem.

Waking up to the cooold, intricate, lovely beats of **THUGWIDOW** on _ULTRASPIRIT_. This one channels some of the best of rave and jungle into our present age. Build on the past—look to the future. Out now on aurawire.

Yes, these are the dark beats that I like. **VVV**'s _Canson Months_ EP builds up an excellent atmosphere and drives a great pulse. Varied and gripping. (2018, Hellscape Recordings)
