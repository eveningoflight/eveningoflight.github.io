**2methyl** - _Etched_ (2017, Agnost1k Records)

Rediscovering this artist after, what, 10 years? Absolutely superb industrial D&B cyberpunk stuff from France. Hits really hard, and surprises with big rhythm shifts and touches of swing and hip hop. Crank it up!

Setting off into the night with the crunchy dark ambient and measured dubby beats of **_BOLT RUIN_** (2019, Circuits / Consouling Sounds). We'll be returning often to this one.

Moving from bright (folk)tronic drones and beats to subtle jazzy alt rock, **CUP**'s debut album _Spinning Creature_ (2019, Northern Spy) is a delight. Surprises at every turn. Makes me smile.

**draag** \- _PHYSICAAL_ (2019) = HARD. ACID. TECHNO.

Will dance to, absorb, and emanate.

**Ill Considered** are a full improv jazz band that above all simply \*rock\* very hard. Can't find a better word for it right now. Super heavy rhythm section, saxes like foghorns. The real deal.

This is nowhere more apparent than on their live registrations, of which _9 - East / West_ is the latest one. A double feature that's yours for a quid + tip, so get going.

Some albums channel the feeling of weird 70s/80s industrial experimentations quite well. That cut-up vibe, the taping together of samples, strange synthetic sounds, and harsh noises.

**Loachfillet**'s 2016 album _Death & Dissatisfaction_ (RATSKIN Records) is one of those albums. I thought I was disinterested when I first put this on, but I let it run out and it gave me all these nice associations. It's a nice trip!

We never did get around to properly reviewing the massive collection that is _Girih: Iranian Sound Artists_ (2018, Zabte Sote). However, this four-part compilation of contemporary Iranian electronic music continues to inspire whenever we pick a few random tracks from it for various uses. As such, we can do nothing but recommend you to take the plunge yourself and see what there is to discover.

This low income $quad compilation is pretty bonkers. A whole bunch of straight-up good hard techno, and some more deconstructed and experimental stuff to boot.

Certainly no monotonous trip, this "Rave Experience" finds a nice balance between variety and consistent dancefloor-readiness.

YEREVAN TAPES doesn't have a super busy release schedule, but I dig most everything that comes out of this Italian tape label's roster. Quality over quantity is something I can get behind.

Anyway, today's spotlight is on **Presente**'s _Ultra Heaven_ (2018), an exciting mix of many electronic and beat-based genres. Ambient bits alternate with grimey beats, drum & bass, and more. Exactly the kind of leftfield dancefloor stuff I'm currently hunting down.

I love **Semiotics Department Of Heteronyms**, and their new EP may be their most focused and condensed work yet. The A-side is stellar darkwave-for-the-dancefloor, with "Suffer" opening things on a melancholic mood, and the goth techno of "No Miracles" basically forcing your feet to move. The latter half is calmer, content to wallow in a sad flow, a counterpoint to the intensity of the first half. I'm very happy to add some of these to my arsenal for imagined future goth dance parties.

_Against Strong Thinking_ is out now on Avant! Records.
