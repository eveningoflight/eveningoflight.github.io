Many good things come in little packages, and that's why the 3" format is so attractive. Something about presenting a little release on a little format is just plain right, and it helps that many of these get released by DIY labels such as the excellent **Reverb Worship**. _Spirit of Being_ is not one of the most recent titles from this label, but it is one of a couple that stood out most from a larger number of releases from 2008 and 2009.

These four tracks start out with a spacy ambient intro, and quickly moving on to freaky electronica combining unusual beats, various melody synths, and glitchy sounds. "Fly", "Walk", and "Swim" offer different modes of travel through a brief realm of shimmering music with a bright and colourful otherworldly atmosphere.

**Pregnant** don't offer anything extremely special with this EP, but it is what it should be: short and sweet. According to the label website, it is still available, but it's a small print run, so act quickly and pick this up if you're into alternative electronica.

Tracklist:

1\. Spirit Of Being (1:48) 2. Fly (5:37) 3. Walk (4:13) 4. Swim (3:48)
