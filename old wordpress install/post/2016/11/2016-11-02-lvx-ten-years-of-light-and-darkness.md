In October 2006, we launched Evening of Light as an outlet for our growing love for alternative folk and ambient music. Over the years, Evening of Light has been an online zine, a label for handmade releases, and a monthly radio show. Not always all at the same time, in the same format, or with the same number of people involved, but always with the same love for music underpinning it.

Now, ten years later, we celebrate our anniversary with this compilation, a gathering of old friends and new ones, all of whom have submitted music, art, and/or writings. We’re immensely grateful for their contributions.

All benefits of this compilation will be donated to [Doctors Without Borders / Médecins Sans Frontières](http://www.msf.org/), who bring aid to victims of war, poverty, and disaster across the world.
