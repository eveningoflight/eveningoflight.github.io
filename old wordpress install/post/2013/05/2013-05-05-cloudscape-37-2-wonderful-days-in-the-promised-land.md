![2013_05_02_300](images/2013_05_02_300.jpg)Today is independence day in the Netherlands, and Summer seems to be finally kicking in for real. We shift gears for an hour or two with a double feature cloudscape, made up of a highly personal selection of house music and related currents. The second one is about finding your way to utopia.

_When we can't find the love we seek, we try to find a way to reach that nowhere land that we keep promising ourselves. Fly the rainbow inwards or to outer space, beyond the waves of time. So beautiful. Maybe in the end we can all be friends._
