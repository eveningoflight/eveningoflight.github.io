![2013_05_1_300](images/2013_05_1_300.jpg)Today is independence day in the Netherlands, and Summer seems to be finally kicking in for real. We shift gears for an hour or two with a double feature cloudscape, made up of a highly personal selection of house music and related currents. The first one is all about love.

_Love. Donna felt it, and the high energies fed into our later vibes. But sometimes we lose it, we wonder where it went, what it is, and when it's finally coming back._
