_Fucking Whore Society_ is **Karjalan Sissit**'s latest full-length album, no doubt eagerly awaited by a growing group of fans. I count myself among the after seeing a stellar performance by the band last year, in which they presented their authentic - and alcohol-drenched - mixture of dark ambient, modern Finnish folklore, and crushing martial industrial sounds.

This new album was released on CD by Cyclic Law and on LP by Eternal Soul, the latter version of which is reviewed here particularly. On the whole, it seems _Fucking Whore Society_ focuses mainly on the variation between threatening ambient pieces and more intense rhythmic industrial tracks, all of which exude an atmosphere of depravity, booze, and misanthropy. Nothing out of the ordinary for **Karjalan Sissit**, in other words. That goes for everything about the album, really. It is subtly different from its predecessors, but not a lot; the titles are a blend of obscenities in Finnish, Swedish, and English, and the quality level is high: dark and ominous when it needs to be, but overpowering and in your face as well.

Nice perks about the LP version are the bonus track ("Rautakeppi"), the limited coloured vinyl editions and the already quite fancy packaging of the regular LP, and the poster.

It's not a surprising record; it won't turn any heads or convert unbelievers. But it's definitely an excellent and powerful album of post-industrial decay music that manages to ask at least some of the right questions in a rotten - sometimes, admittedly - society: "har du horat runt på campingen?" _Have you been whoring around on the camping?_
