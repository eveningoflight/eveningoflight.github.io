**Absent** is a French electronica duo and _Absent's Children_ is their latest release, officially an EP. However, several friends from the French underground have joined in and remixed the four original tracks, bringing this CD to a total of eight tracks. This concept works flawlessly, for the remixes give a very different new twist to the tracks, so that we recognise some elements from the original versions, creating a pleasant reminiscent feeling without becoming redundant.

The style of the EP can best be described broadly as alternative dark electronica, mixing elements of glitch, ambient and IDM with a touch of noise. Melodies are quite prominent throughout, while the rhythms are mostly subtle and glitchy, though sometimes reaching a more intense level, such as on "La Capacité D'Être Seul" or **Ten Data Keshin**'s remix "Dark Corridor", both of which are among the highlights on the album.

At times, I feel the EP is somewhat too abstract or sterile, and a bit more original elements could have made it stand out more among similar music. All the same, this is a well-produced electronica album with a seriously good groove and flow, and a pleasant level of detail. Certainly recommended to lovers of electronic music, and a project that's worth keeping an eye on.
