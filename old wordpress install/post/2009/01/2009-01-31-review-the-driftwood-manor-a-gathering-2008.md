**The Driftwood Manor** is a new band based in Ballymahon, Ireland that plays a kind of acoustic alternative rock, but with a strong dose of folk thrown in, both free and traditional. Little surprise if you look at the lineup, which apart from main songwriter and vocalist Eddie Keenan includes David Colohan (**Agitated Radio Pilot**, **United Bible Studies**, etc.) and Bean Dolan (**Resurrection Fern**), but also traditional fiddler Neil Fitzgibbon, among others. This short debut album is self-released on pro CDr, and actually of a very high quality.

The album starts off with an instrumental, which has a very dronish buildup and melancholic tinge. This shifts, however, to the second one - "To The Waves" - which is uptempo and combines a longing neofolk track (in the broad sense) with some traditional fiddling. There is much variety, though, as the three middle tracks illustrate. "Pyre" is a calm alternative folk ballad with female second vocals and tracks 5 and 6 show a relaxed, though still melancholic, singer/songwriter style. The final tracks contain a similar mixture of styles, from the uptempo "The Sense Of An Ending" - with more female vocals and also a trumpet - to the serenity of "Trial By Fire". The sound is also quite enjoyable: very crisp, yet organic and idiosyncratic, particularly the drums and fiddle.

While I wouldn't say this is a very innovative album, I've been playing it very often lately, as there is simply a lot of good songwriting in here. Another piece of evidence that Ireland is a nation of true artistry in the realm of popular music. This is a highly recommended and promising debut for any lover of alternative folk.
