![](images/lisaopiu_wwhs.jpg)artist: **Lisa O Piu** release: _Whisperers, Wavers, Hunters And Sailors_ format: 7" year of release: 2008 label: [Autumn Ferment](http://www.autumnfermentrecords.com/) duration: 9:01

detailed info: [discogs.com](http://www.discogs.com/Lisa-O-Piu-Whisperers-Wavers-Hunters-And-Sailors/release/1618232).

This 7" with the cute cover drawing - including squirrels playing flute! - is the first release on **James Reid**'s Autumn Ferment label. This Scottish imprint focuses on alternative folk in many guises, and looks to be a promising endeavour. **Lisa O Piu** is a Swedish lady playing a recognisable and pleasant style of singer/songwriter folk, and this single reproduces two tracks from a highly limited CDr on the Swedish HÃ¶r upp label.

The A-side is a nice uptempo track interweaving fingerpicked acoustic guitar and vocals, with a touch of electric guitar here and there. Like the cover art suggests, the music creates a dreamy, natural atmosphere. The B-side contains a more calm and melancholic track, which highlights another side of Lisa's music, which is not incredibly original in terms of style, but which still manages to be expressed in a fresh and interesting own language. I feel a strong conceptual vision and world behind these songs, which makes these relatively simple songs fascinating.

As a single should be, _Whisperers, Wavers..._ is short and sweet, and it is a promising first release for both the label and the artist. Certainly worth checking out if you enjoy alternative folk with a female voice.
