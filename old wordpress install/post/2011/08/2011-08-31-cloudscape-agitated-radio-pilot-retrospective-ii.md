To celebrate the release of [_Light Beneath the Lake / Nothing Is Truly Lost_](../../2011/07/23/eol03-agitated-radio-pilot-lights-beneath-the-lake-nothing-is-truly-lost/ ":EOL03: Agitated Radio Pilot – Lights Beneath the Lake / Nothing Is Truly Lost") (:EOL03:) by one of our favourite artists, **Agitated Radio Pilot** (**David Colohan**), we have compiled two retrospective cloudscapes with personal selections the artist’s back catalogue, and a couple of tracks from our own release, which is available now. Apart from :EOL03:, there will be a few more **ARP** releases on other labels, but after that, David is laying the project to rest. Another reason to look back!

This second retrospective includes more lovely tracks from important ARP albums, as well as others of Dave's projects and guest appearances, such as **Holt**, **The Driftwood Manor**, **Children of the Stones, United Bible Studies,** and **The Magickal Folk of the Faraway Tree**. Enjoy!
