To celebrate the release of [_Light Beneath the Lake / Nothing Is Truly Lost_](http://www.eveningoflight.nl/2011/07/23/eol03-agitated-radio-pilot-lights-beneath-the-lake-nothing-is-truly-lost/ ":EOL03: Agitated Radio Pilot – Lights Beneath the Lake / Nothing Is Truly Lost") (:EOL03:) by one of our favourite artists, **Agitated Radio Pilot** (**David Colohan**), we have compiled two retrospective cloudscapes with personal selections the artist's back catalogue, and a couple of tracks from our own release, which is available now. Apart from :EOL03:, there will be a few more **ARP** releases on other labels, but after that, David is laying the project to rest. Another reason to look back!

This first retrospective contains mostly **ARP** album material, with a couple of tracks by **United Bible Studies,** and one from **Holt**, another band in which David was active. Enjoy!
