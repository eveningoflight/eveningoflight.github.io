[![](images/cover2.jpg "cloisters_lw")](http://www.eveningoflight.nl/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/cover2.jpg)artist: **The Cloisters** release: _Little Winter_ format: Digital year of release: 2011 label: [Self-released](http://iamplinth.bandcamp.com/album/little-winter) duration: 19:31

Popping up during the last weeks of 2011, _Little Winter_ has wormed its way among my favourite albums of the year in a couple of days. Behind this release are **Michael Tanner** and **Aine O'Dwyer,** who've played with **United Bible Studies**, among others, and whose collaboration in this year's _[The A. Lords](http://www.eveningoflight.nl/2011/10/16/review-the-a-lords-2011/ "Review: The A. Lords (2011)")_ LP was particularly beautiful.

Aine's beautiful harp work opens the album, while Michael provides field recordings, vocal samples, and various instruments (organ, accordion drones, strings) to create a wonderful mixture of ambient and folky melodies that go perfectly with the weather and the dark days of winter. "Hvislyse" again beings with a harp melody, a yuletide tune most likely, though I can't for the life of me recall which. Doesn't matter, as the duelling of low and high notes is spot-on, and builds the way for a mournful layer of string drones. "Pesta Komm" is a short coda of echoing bells, mysterious and cold.

_Little Winter_ is aptly short, but precisely the ticket for your stay-at-home winter holidays. It might get cold outside, but stick this on and make sure it's nice and cosy indoors, and you've got the perfect mood. Apparently, this EP is a precursor to a full-length next year, and I can't wait until it's there. Until then, make sure you pick this one up, as it's pay-what-you-want for a high quality digital download to boot!
