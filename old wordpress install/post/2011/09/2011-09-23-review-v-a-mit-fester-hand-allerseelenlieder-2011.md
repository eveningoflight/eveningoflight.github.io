A compilation dedicated to the long-standing Austrian industrial project **A**ll**erseelen** is a very understandable thing, after over twenty years of activity in the European underground. Drawing mostly from the rich roster of **Steinklang**/**Ahnstern** label artists, _Mit Fester Hand_ presents an interesting overview of Allerseelen work in varying interpretations, though mostly within the neofolk corner.

An individual treatment of all tracks on this compilation would be a bit too much, in my opinion, but there are certainly quite a few tracks worth mentioning on the CD. Not everything is very exciting, and the compilation has a rather unassuming take-off with a few average tracks, but the overall sound is constant and pleasant to listen to. In my opinion, things start to take off properly with the organ-heavy version of  "Flamme" by **Die Weisse Rose**. The **Blood Axis** & **Sangre Cavallum** version of "Sonne Golthi-Ade" is also very nice, particularly because of the organic folk sound, and the typical mediterranean instrumentation we can hear on other Sangre Cavallum work. **Larrnakh** provide an atmospheric point of rest in the album with a great mixture of ambient and folk styles. **Àrnica** in their turn impress me with a very stripped down folk style that feels very ritual and intimate. One of my favourite tracks must be the surprising "Flama" by **Der Arbeiter**, a very well-flowing flamenco-inspired track. Also interesting - both kitschy and catchy - is the bombastic electro of **Der Feuerkreiner** on "Feuersalamander". The **Svarrogh** version of "Heiliges Blut" deserves mention too, not in the least because of its playful nod towards **NON**'s "Total War". Closing off the album is obviously the title track in its **Allerseelen** version, a powerful track with beat and martial samples, dedicated to a radical self-transformation. A pity that the **Von Thronstahl** version of this track wasn't included as well (released last year by **Cold Spring** on the _Conscriptum_ compilation) as it too provides a powerful version of this song.

Though not everything on _Mit Fester Hand_ is pure gold, I'd say it is a very honourable tribute to **Allerseelen** and an important part of any collection of that band's works, as well as an interesting release to check out for anyone in the European industrial/neofolk area.
