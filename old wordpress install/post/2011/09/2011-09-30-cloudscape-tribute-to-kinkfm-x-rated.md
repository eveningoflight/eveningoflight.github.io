At midnight between September 30th and October 1st the Dutch alternative radio station **Kink FM** was shut down after 16 years of dedicated broadcasting. Apart form this being a general loss for the Dutch radio landscape, it is even worse for lovers of music in the styles we usually cover on Evening of Light. For with the end of the station comes the end of the program (and since this year 24 hour channel) Kink X-Rated.

Running since the start of the station, X-Rated was the home for experimental music, industrial, wave, neofolk, ambient, drone, and all sorts of other great music. The program was first presented by **Arjen Grolleman**, [who tragically passed away last year](http://www.eveningoflight.nl/2010/01/21/in-memoriam-arjen-grolleman-1972-2010/ "In Memoriam: Arjen Grolleman (1972 – 2010)"), and **Bauke van der Wal**. Later, Arjen presented the program together with **Bob Rusche**, who sold records in Boudisque, formerly the best record store in Amsterdam, and another institution that has passed away.

Now that Kink FM is closing down, due to dubious decisionmaking by the overarching media investment company, it also means an end to these 16 years of X-Rated in which we discovered so much great music, heard lovely interviews and live performances, and were blessed enough to be guests in the studio several times. There is light at the end of the tunnel, and Bob will be able to continue the program X-Rated at a new station, the [Concertzender](http://www.concertzender.nl/), but there is no doubt that the closing of KinkFM is black moment in Dutch pop history.

The mix we have prepared here is a modest tribute of ours to the music of X-Rated. Music we discovered through the program, music which is typical for the program, or otherwise came to mind. For example, **Coil**, **Current 93**, and **Sol Invictus** were always staple artists in the program, as heroes of the (post-)industrial music world, while **Raison d'Être**'s _Enthraled by the Wind of Lonelienes_ was the first album we ever bought in the Boudisque shop. X-Rated also functioned as our introduction to the wonderful music of **Maarten van der Vleuten**, which eventually led to us releasing one of his later albums. All of the tracks here have an emotional value like that, and we hope we will be able to share it with you, and give an impression of what X-Rated was (partly) about.

An immense thanks to Bob, Arjen (rest in peace!) and everyone at KinkFM for making this possible!
