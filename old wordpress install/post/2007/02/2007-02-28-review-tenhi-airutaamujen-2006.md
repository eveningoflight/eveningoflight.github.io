This is the second **Tenhi** release of 2006, but a misleading one, as it was already released in 2004 under the artist name of **Harmaa**. The album was originally conceived as a side project to continute the saga that started with the _airut:ciwi_ EP. Apparently the band decided it would be proper to rerelease it under the **Tenhi** name. It think it's a good decision, as it will bring more attention to this excellent album.

_airut:aamujen_ is different from other **Tenhi** material, because of the stripped down instrumentation. This album is played solely on drums, bass and piano, though with the trademark vocals, here and there supported by the female singer **Janina Lehto**. Needless to say, the piano plays a leading role on this album, and in that respect it is similar to some tracks on _Maaäet_. It doesn't really sound like a musical sequel to _airut:ciwi_, though, except perhaps to the beautiful "Kielo", which featured on that release.

Besides this, it is the familiar **Tenhi** style. Idiosyncratic tracks with some folk influences, but most of all, a rich, sometimes dark atmosphere. While some artists have the power to accurately depict certain moods or stories, **Tenhi** always sounds more abstract. To me, it doesn't conjure up any particular images. Instead, the music speaks to me directly, which is touching all in its own way. Because of that, **Tenhi** is comparable to only a few other artists. All tracks on this album are very strong, but I like "seitsensarvi", "kuvajainen" (a great instrumental experiment) and "hiensynty" in particular.

_airut:aamujen_ shows that **Tenhi**, in between the two wonderful _Väre_ and _Maaäet_ albums, had enough inspiration left to produce this little gem. An excellent album by one of my favourite artists of today, and recommended to all lovers of original acoustic music.
